Space
=====

Just a todo list for my brain to dump stuff.

**Currently**
+ Generates a galaxy.
+ Galaxy between 50 & 200 units big.
+ Objects in galaxy have random id/name.
+ Planets generate with possible change for multiple moons.
+ Largest possible galaxy can generate around 800k stars, 2.4m planets & 5.7m moons in 42,100ms.
+ Smallest possible galaxy can generate around 49k stars, 150k planets & 360k moons in 1200ms.
+ Planets simulated per second range from 5.4m to 6.8m.

**Planets**
+ Random size and distance from star.
+ ~~Random chance for moon(s).~~

**Stars**
+ ~~Generated with possible chance for multiple planets.~~
+ Should really have the following units od measurement.
  + Solar Mass
  + Solar Luminosity
  + Solar Radius
+ These values should decide the life span and temperature of star.
+ Also define where habital zone of star is.
  + If planet distance if in habital zone. Life can form.

**Nebula**
+ Formed when star goes supernova.
+ If nebula is big enough it will form a new star.
+ Else nebula will disapate.
+ Contain excotic materials.

**Black Holes**
+ Formed when dense star colapses in on it self.
